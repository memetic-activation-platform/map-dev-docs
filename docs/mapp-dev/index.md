# MAP Application Developer Documentation

Welcome to the MAP Application Developer Documentation.

This site is intended for developers building **applications, tools, and integrations** on top of the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP), without requiring deep knowledge of MAP’s internal architecture or core protocols.

MAP applications (MAPs) operate within agent spaces, interact through trust channels, and leverage MAP’s type system and runtime services to deliver meaningful, adaptive experiences.

## Who this documentation is for

This documentation is designed for:

- Application developers building MAP-enabled tools or experiences
- SDK users working with the MAP APIs
- Developers integrating MAP services into external systems
- Contributors extending MAP through supported extension points

It is **not** intended as a reference for MAP core architecture or internal system design. Those materials live in the Core Developer Docs.

## What you’ll find here

Topics covered in this site include:

- MAP application architecture and extension patterns
- SDKs and developer APIs
- Holon Data Loader usage for application-level schemas
- Trust channel usage from an application perspective
- Security and responsibility boundaries relevant to app developers

Where relevant, this documentation links to shared conceptual material (e.g. glossary entries), but avoids exposing internal core design details.

## Getting started

If you are new to MAP application development:

- Start with the overview sections to understand how MAP applications fit into the broader ecosystem
- Review the SDK and API guides relevant to your target environment
- Explore example schemas and application patterns as they become available

This documentation will continue to evolve alongside the MAP platform and its developer tooling.
