# **DAHN Project Brief**
### *Dynamic Adaptive Holon Navigator*
**Seeking HX | HI Designers & Developers for an Open-Source, Commons-Building Effort**

## **What is DAHN?**
**DAHN (Dynamic Adaptive Holon Navigator)** is a new kind of human-experience runtime — a framework-neutral, multi-device, semantic interface engine that *generates coherent, personalized experiences at runtime*.

DAHN is part of the **MAP (Memetic Activation Platform)** ecosystem, where all data, behaviors, and capabilities are expressed as **self-describing holons**. DAHN interprets these holons and assembles an interface dynamically, balancing personal preference, adaptive defaults, device context, and community usage patterns.

DAHN is **not** a UI framework. It is a **meta-interface layer** for creating meaning-rich, adaptive, coherent human experiences across the entire MAP ecosystem.

---

## **Open-Source and Commons-Based**
DAHN is an **open-source project**, built as a **commons** with the intent that everyone can use, extend, and contribute to it.

Most work is:

- **Volunteer-driven**,
- **Collaborative**,
- **Community-governed**,
- And focused on **seeding a shared Visualizer Commons**.

### **Funding**
We have *limited funding* available. 

To support contributors equitably, we are exploring a **bounty-based model**:

- modest bounties for well-defined deliverables
- paid upon completion and acceptance
- open to anyone contributing meaningful work

This ensures contributors receive recognition and some compensation without creating barriers to participation.

---

## **Why DAHN Exists**
Traditional UX forces people to navigate dozens of apps, each with its own separate experience. DAHN inverts this relationship:

- Instead of applications dictating UX → **people shape their own UX**
- Instead of static screens → **DAHN generates the experience dynamically**
- Instead of siloed interfaces → **all holons share one coherent experiential grammar**

This unlocks:

- **Cross-application coherence**
- **Personalization centered on human meaning**
- **Multi-device adaptation**
- **Commons-driven UX evolution**
- **Semantic visualization across all MAP data**

---

## **Key Concepts**

### **Holons**
Self-describing entities with:

- properties
- relationships
- behavior affordances (“dances”)
- semantic metadata

Holons allow DAHN to generate UI from meaning, not from hard-coded views.

### **Visualizers**
Reusable visualization components (Web Components) that can express a holon or relationship:

- Form visualizers
- Graph visualizers
- Card/list/table views
- 3D and XR renderers
- Flow, spatial, and narrative visualizations

Visualizers can be built in *any frontend stack* and compiled to Web Components, lowering barriers to contribution.

### **Canvases**
Device-adaptive experiential containers that:

- manage layout
- apply themes
- interpret the Meta Design System
- handle breakpoints, density, and input modality
- coordinate visualizers and actions

### **Meta Design System (MDS)**
A semantic design grammar defining:

- roles (Surface, PrimaryAction, AccentText, etc.)
- spacing scales
- typographic hierarchies
- motion semantics

The MDS ensures coherent experience across visualizers and devices.

### **Themes**
Token sets assigning visual values (colors, shadows, typography) to MDS roles.

---

## **The DAHN Runtime**
DAHN dynamically selects visualizers based on:

- holon type
- device class
- personal preferences
- salience gestures
- community-wide usage patterns
- capability affordances

This produces a **crowd-adapted default** UX that remains **personally tunable** — a powerful blend of community wisdom and individual agency.

---

## **Why Contribute**
DAHN offers a unique opportunity to help design and build an entirely new experiential paradigm — one that is:

- Person-centered
- Commons-based
- Semantically grounded
- Multi-device native
- Framework-neutral
- Technically elegant
- Open to diverse creative contributions

We welcome designers and developers who:

- are curious about new paradigms,
- enjoy pushing the boundaries of interface design,
- and want to help build a humane, adaptive experience layer for a new kind of computing ecosystem.

---

## **Who We Are Looking For**

### **HX / HI Designers**
People who enjoy:

- designing semantic systems
- exploring novel experience grammars
- building adaptive, multi-device interactions
- creating visual and auditory coherence at scale
- translating ontology into human experience

### **Developers**
People comfortable with:

- building Web Components (Lit, Svelte, React/CE, Vanilla)
- dynamic module loading
- visualization techniques (2D, 3D, XR, flows)
- TypeScript and browser APIs
- collaborating with Rust-backed state via a simple SDK

---

## **Contribution Models**
We support multiple modes of involvement:

### **Volunteer Contribution**
Open-ended, collaborative work for people excited about the vision.

### **Bounty-Based Tasks** *(limited budget)*
Well-scoped, discrete deliverables that come with modest financial rewards.  
Examples:

- Implement a Form Visualizer
- Create the initial MDS token set
- Build a responsive Canvas archetype
- Develop the initial D-Selector logic
- Package a theme system

### **Commons Stewardship**
For contributors who want to shape longer-term governance, documentation, or curation of the Visualizer Commons.

---

## **If This Resonates**
We’d love to talk if you want to:

- Help define the Meta Design System
- Contribute early visualizers
- Develop adaptive canvases
- Implement the runtime
- Seed the Visualizer Commons
- Explore a radically new HX/HI paradigm

**DAHN needs thoughtful, curious, flexible designers and developers.  
If that sounds like you — welcome.**
