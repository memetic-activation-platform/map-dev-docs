# **The SEA Manifesto**
### *The Semantic Experience Architecture*
## **1. Experience should belong to the person, not the application.**
Most current applications work hard to achieve internal coherence — consistent patterns, menus, gestures, controls, layouts, and visual systems. But that coherence is confined to the application itself. Each application defines its own experiential world, with its own assumptions and design logic.  When a person moves between these worlds — often dozens of times a day — their experience becomes fragmented, **no matter how coherent each individual application may be**.

This fragmentation isn’t intentional. It’s a byproduct of a deeper architectural truth: **interfaces are bound to applications, not to people.**

SEA reverses this.

**With SEA, coherence follows the person across applications.**

---

## **2. Experience should be composed, not predesigned.**

Most interfaces are frozen at design time. Screens are drawn, layouts are fixed, and interactions are hard-wired long before anyone encounters real meaning, real context, or real change.

SEA rejects this rigidity.

In SEA, experience is **composed at runtime** — not from static screens, but from living components chosen in response to meaning. Semantic structure guides which visualizers are applicable and what they are responsible for expressing. But the choice of visualizers and how they are configured is made dynamically.

This shift is subtle but profound:

- Screens stop being the unit of design.
- Components become composable.
- Meaning becomes the organizing force.

**Experience is no longer something we design once and ship.  
It is something the system continuously composes.**
---

## **3. Semantics enable interoperability — not uniformity.**

Visual coherence comes from design choices: layout, color, typography, motion, sound. SEA does not standardize these. Instead, SEA deliberately **separates semantics from semiotics**.

Semantics describe *what something is* and *how it relates* —  
not *how it should look*.

This separation is what makes SEA powerful:

- the same meaning can be expressed in many visual languages
- radically different canvases can coexist
- visualizers can vary without breaking interoperability
- coherence can be chosen, not imposed

In SEA, **semantics provide a shared substrate**. Canvases and themes provide perceptual coherence.

---

## **4. The interface layer should be open, pluralistic, and framework-neutral.**
Today’s ecosystems are divided by allegiance to frameworks: React, Svelte, Vue, Angular, SwiftUI, Flutter…

SEA transcends this.

- Web Components provide a universal boundary
- Visualizers can be written in any stack
- Canvases manage adaptation and layout
- Designers define semantics once, and all visualizers inherit them

**The experience layer must be a commons, not an empire.**

---

## **5. Experience must adapt — to people, to devices, to context.**
A phone is not a tablet.  
A tablet is not a desktop.  
A desktop is not a projection wall.  
A wall is not a VR space.  
A VR space is not a voice-only interface.

Most systems respond to this with a patchwork of responsive hacks and media queries.

SEA handles this semantically.

**Canvases adapt. Visualizers stay simple.**  
DAHN (SEA’s reference implementation) selects visualizers using:
- device class
- holon type
- input modality
- personal preference
- community usage
- salience gestures
- context

Adaptation is not bolted on — it's intrinsic.

---

## **6. Experience should evolve through use.**
In the old model:
- designers guess what people need
- developers implement it
- people adapt to the result

In SEA:
- people express salience (what matters)
- they choose visualizers
- they adjust layouts
- they navigate relationships
- they reveal patterns through action

The system learns.

**Defaults become crowd-informed.  
Personalization becomes effortless.  
Experience becomes emergent.**

---

## **7. Contributions should grow the commons, not fragment it.**
SEA is open-source, volunteer-driven, and commons-oriented.

We invite:
- HX/HI designers
- Visualization developers
- Systems thinkers
- Ontology stewards
- Experience researchers
- Creative technologists
- Artists
- Toolmakers

Every visualizer, canvas, or design system added to the commons becomes a gift — not a fragment.

**Contribution is how the architecture evolves.  
Stewardship is how it becomes humane.**

---

## **8. Technology should honor human complexity, not reduce it.**
Humans are not “users.”  
They are people — multi-dimensional, contextual, embodied, relational.

SEA is built to reflect that.

- Semantic roles
- Context-aware adaptation
- Person-centric coherence
- Holonic structure
- Meaning-first modeling
- Multiple modalities

**SEA respects the full spectrum of human experience.**

---

## **9. The interface should be a living ecosystem.**

Static interfaces decay.  
Hard-coded interactions fossilize.  
Frameworks rise and fall.

SEA remains alive because **meaning and expression evolve independently**.

With SEA:
- semantics can evolve without redesign
- new canvases can appear without schema changes
- visual languages can shift without breaking meaning
- themes can reflect personal or cultural taste
- experience remains coherent because coherence is chosen

**Interfaces don’t converge on sameness.  
They remain diverse — without fragmenting meaning.**
---

## **10. A more humane digital world is possible — and SEA is a path toward it.**
We believe the future of computing is not app-centric but person-centric; not screen-driven but meaning-driven;  
not rigid but adaptive;
not proprietary but shared.

SEA is a step toward that future.

A world where:
- experience emerges from holons
- meaning is shared through semantics
- coherence is shaped by people, across their whole experience — not by apps
- adaptation is natural
- the commons grows stronger with every contribution
- and people remain at the center of their digital lives

If this vision resonates…

## **Invitation to the SEA Commons**

If the ideas in this manifesto resonate — if you’re excited by a future where experience is generated from meaning, shaped by people, adapted through use, and shared across an open commons — we invite you to join us.

SEA is an open-source, volunteer-driven effort, with modest bounties available for well-defined contributions.  
We welcome people from every discipline:

- HX / HI designers
- Visual systems and interaction designers
- UI developers and toolmakers
- Visualization experts (2D, 3D, XR)
- Ontology and semantic modelers
- Systems thinkers and experience architects
- Artists and creative technologists

You don’t need to commit to a specific framework.  
You don’t need to buy into a particular toolchain.  
SEA is framework-neutral and pluralistic by design:

- Build visualizers in the stack you love
- Contribute canvases or themes
- Help define the Meta Design System
- Prototype adaptive interactions
- Grow the Visualizer Commons
- Shape the reference implementation — **DAHN**
- Participate in a shared ecosystem where your work benefits everyone

Whether you want to contribute a single visualizer, refine semantic roles, design a canvas, or help steward the commons, your creativity is welcome — and your work will have real impact.

If you’ve been looking for a place to push the boundaries of experience design,  
if you’ve been searching for a paradigm that feels worthy of your craft,  
if you want to help build a humane, adaptive, meaning-centered interface layer for the future…
