# Sovereign Data Sphere

The **Sovereign Data Sphere (SDS)** is the complete, membrane-bound informational world stewarded by an Agent in the MAP. It is the Agent’s private, authoritative graph of all holons it owns, all relationships it maintains, and all references it relies upon. The SDS is the interior substrate of the AgentSpace’s I-Space — the locus of memory, meaning, identity, lineage, and internal intelligence.

It represents the Agent’s entire informational reality: all data it holds, all commitments it understands, all dependencies it tracks, and all meaning structures that shape its participation in the world.

---

## Purpose

### **1. Establish a Sovereign, Self-Stewarded Information World**
The SDS gives each Agent full, lifetime sovereignty over its own data.  
All mapps write into a single, agent-controlled substrate.  
No external actor or We-Space can claim stewardship over the holons within it.

### **2. Provide a Single Authoritative Source of Truth**
All of the Agent’s information — regardless of origin or context — is unified into one consistent, self-contained graph.  
This eliminates fragmentation, duplication, and loss of coherence across applications or spaces.

### **3. Anchor Identity, Continuity, and Meaning-Making**
The SDS holds the internal expression of the Agent’s LifeCode, its identity and personas, its memetic structures, and its private reflections.  
It preserves narrative continuity over time.

### **4. Power Internal Intelligence and Sub-Agents**
Every internal assistant, persona, automation, or sub-agent operates against the SDS.  
It is the data substrate for cognition, interpretation, and internal decision-making.

### **5. Maintain a Protected Domain for Private Exploration**
Drafts, half-formed ideas, private commitments, and unshared meaning structures live here — visible only to the Agent unless shared via a Trust Channel.

## Architectural Role

### **• Interior to the Agent (I-Space)**
The SDS is part of the Agent’s interior aspect.  
It is not stored inside any We-Space, nor subordinate to any shared context.  
It moves with the Agent across all relationships and commitments.

### **• Membrane-Enclosed and Consent-Governed**
All access to the SDS is mediated by:
- the Agent’s membrane
- Trust Channels
- explicit Agreements

The membrane does not enclose the SDS inside a group context;  
it protects the SDS *from* the outside world.

### **• Unified Substrate for All Mapps**
Every mapp the Agent uses writes to the same SDS.  
This agent-centric architecture replaces app-centric silos.

### **• Graph-Native and Holon-Native**
The SDS is a holonic knowledge graph containing:
- holons the Agent stewards
- relationship holons
- metadata
- lineage and provenance graphs
- semantic structures
- references to holons stewarded by others

The SDS is the Agent’s **complete, living graph**.

---

## What the SDS Contains

The SDS contains a rich mixture of holons and graph-relationships that represent the Agent’s entire informational world.

### **1. Holons Stewarded by the Agent**
These are holons for which the Agent has full custodianship, including:
- personal data
- mapp-generated data
- identity and persona structures
- commitments the Agent owns
- sub-agent configurations
- internal processes and automations
- values, principles, and meaning structures
- lineage, provenance, and derived-from histories
- private reflections and drafts

These holons physically live inside the SDS and are under the Agent’s exclusive stewardship.

---

### **2. References to Holons Stewarded by Other Agents**
This is the newly clarified and essential dimension.

The SDS also stores:
- **references to external holons**
- **representational pointers to shared objects**
- **dependency links to foreign data**
- **caches of previously observed states (when allowed)**
- **relationship holons pointing outward**
- **referrals into peer Agents’ SDSs**

These references allow the Agent to:
- participate in Agreements
- understand group commitments
- interact in We-Spaces
- rely on shared meaning structures
- contextualize its own data relative to others
- respond to promises and offers
- interpret the world beyond itself

Crucially:

### **The SDS never becomes the steward of foreign holons.**
It only holds references, pointers, or derived views allowed by Trust Channels.

This preserves data sovereignty while enabling interdependence.

---

### **3. Provenance, Lineage, and History**
The SDS captures:
- time-ordered event representation
- derived-from edges
- version histories
- memetic evolution paths
- validation proofs
- audit trails
- trust-chain histories

These structures make meaning evolution and conflict resolution possible.

---

### **4. Identity, Roles, and Persona Holons**
The SDS contains:
- the Agent’s identity holons
- alternate personas
- role templates
- authentication anchors
- internal continuity metadata

These never reside in external Spaces.

---

### **5. Private Meaning Structures**
The SDS stores:
- LifeCode as interiority
- memetic signature components
- values and principles
- worldview mappings
- personal semantics
- memory interpretations
- context markers and salience graphs

This is the “inner narrative substrate.”

---

### **6. Sub-Agents and Internal Processes**
All components the Agent hosts internally — from assistants and workflows to embedded reasoning agents — operate against holons stored in the SDS.

---

### **7. Trust, Policy, and Visibility Rules**
The SDS records:
- visibility permissions
- trust-channel policies
- conditions of secrecy or disclosure
- revocation logs
- scope constraints

These constitute the Agent’s privacy regime.

---

## What the SDS Does *Not* Contain

### ❌ **We-Spaces or Group Data**
AgentSpaces for collective participation remain external contexts.  
The SDS stores only the Agent’s perspective and commitments.

### ❌ **Holons Stewarded by Others**
Even when interacting closely, the SDS never imports foreign holons.

### ❌ **Shared State**
Shared state lives in the We-Space; the SDS stores the Agent’s local view of it.

### ❌ **Active Interaction Dynamics**
Live Dances, flows, and roles-in-motion belong to the We-Space context.

---

## Relationship to the Agent and MAP

### **The SDS is the Agent’s sovereign interior world**
It contains everything the Agent stewards, remembers, interprets, or depends on.

### **The SDS travels with the Agent across all We-Spaces**
Nothing in the SDS becomes “owned” by a group context.

### **The SDS enables trust-channel mediation**
Because data is never copied into shared spaces, all flows across membranes are explicitly consented.

### **The SDS enables agent-centric computing**
All mapps operate against a single, Agent-owned data world.

### **The SDS preserves autonomy across scales**
Whether the Agent is a person, a community, or a bioregion, the SDS anchors its informational sovereignty.

## Summary

The **Sovereign Data Sphere** is the Agent’s complete interior knowledge world — a membrane-protected domain holding every holon it stewards and every reference it depends on. It is the authoritative graph of memory, meaning, commitments, identity, sub-agents, lineage, and dependencies. It ensures data sovereignty, supports trust-channel governance, powers internal intelligence, and provides the foundation for safe participation in We-Spaces across every scale of agency.
