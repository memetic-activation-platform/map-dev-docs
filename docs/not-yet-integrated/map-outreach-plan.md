# 🌿 Integrated Outreach & Narrative Plan 

This revised plan integrates:
- **Developer outreach** (CTA, Holochain, BRANE, Maptio)
- **Cultural-memetic narrative** (Planet Project blogs, Design School)
- **Thought-leader engagement** (R3.0, Design School mentors)
- **Strategic pacing** (MAP internal readiness + DAHN recruitment)

The key addition is a **December R3.0 touchpoint**, using the pre-release “Living Through Collapse” blog as an intimate, behind-the-scenes invitation.

The result is a coherent, multi-arc unfolding that builds conceptual alignment, developer momentum, and cultural resonance — without premature exposure.

# 🧭 Three-Arcs Model

1. **Developer / Infrastructure Arc**  
   CTA → Holochain → BRANE → Maptio → DAHN team formation

2. **Cultural-Memetic Arc**  
   Living Through Collapse → Spiral Outcomes → Collaboration at Scale → Promise Weave → Technology as if Life Mattered  
   *(R3.0 belongs here — in the inner ring)*

3. **Public Narrative & Thought Leadership Arc**  
   Planet Project → Design School → LinkedIn → collapse-aware communities

R3.0 is incorporated into **Arc 2**, where they serve as early conceptual allies and validators of MAP’s systemic design.

# 📅 Month-by-Month Timeline (Updated)

---

## **Now → Mid-December 2025**

### 🔥 1. **Share pre-release draft of “Living Through Collapse” with R3.0 (Bill Baue)**
This mirrors your outreach to:
- Joe Brewer
- Penny
- Neil Davidson

It signals:
- trust
- inclusion
- early partnership
- conceptual respect

And it primes R3.0 to see themselves reflected in your synthesis.

### 🔥 2. **Schedule Early/Mid December call with R3.0**
This is a **quiet, intimate, behind-the-curtain session**.

Goals:
- Show how **context-based sustainability**, **vital capital**, and **bioregional governance** are now structurally integrated into MAP.
- Highlight Promise Weaves, Agent Holarchy, and sustainability thresholds.
- Introduce the *Understanding the MAP* narrative.
- Explore mutual resonance.
- Invite conceptual feedback (not commitments).

*This conversation seeds alignment before public visibility.*

### 🔥 3. Prepare CTA presentation outline + early visuals
You will need:
- MAP architectural narrative
- DAHN vision
- Recruitment call
- High-level visuals
- Recorded-session plan

### 🔥 4. Continue core backend work
Holon Loader, inverse relationship generation, descriptor wiring.

### 🔥 5. Publish **Living Through Collapse** mid-December via Planet Project
Then post in Design School → LinkedIn → collapse-aware circles.

---

## **Mid-Dec → Jan 1, 2026**

- Let the Collapse blog ripple outward.
- Post older blogs on LinkedIn for gentle narrative pacing:
    - Spiral Outcomes
    - Promise Weave (Nature Doesn’t Have a Police Force)
    - Fostering Collaboration at Scale
- Invite R3.0 to share any final reflections.
- Schedule CTA update session for **Jan 8–18**.

---

## **Early–Mid January 2026 — CTA UPDATE SESSION**

🔥 **This is the technical ignition point for DAHN recruitment.**

### Objectives:
- Reveal MAP architectural readiness
- Explain holonic data, membranes, directories, and self-describing types
- Introduce DAHN (Dynamic Adaptive Holon Navigator)
- Invite HX designers, front-end architects, visualizer creators
- Generate developer momentum
- Produce a recording + slides for future outreach

### Outputs:
- Initial DAHN collaborator pipeline
- Questions to refine your messaging
- Credible artifact to take to Holochain, BRANE, Maptio in March/April

---

## **Late January – February 2026**

### 🌱 Follow-up with CTA participants
- 1:1 conversations
- Clarify DAHN roles
- Begin architectural conversations with early contributors

### 🌱 Build a polished outreach kit
- CTA recording
- Slide deck
- DAHN concept visuals
- Short narrative summary
- Designed for Holochain + BRANE/Maptio

### 🌱 Maintain public narrative pacing
- Post additional Planet Project blogs
- Reinforce collapse-aware framing

### 🌱 Begin preparing for March flagship blog
- “Technology as if Life Mattered”

---

## **March 2026 — Publish *Technology as if Life Mattered***

🌱 **This is the pivotal narrative moment.**

It connects:
- collapse acceptance
- regenerative culture
- governance redesign
- bioregionalism
- system re-architecture  
  **→ into the need for a fundamentally different technology layer.**

This is where MAP becomes *inevitable* in the reader’s mind.

R3.0, already aligned, sees MAP as the emergent infrastructure for:
- context-based sustainability
- threshold metrics
- vital capital flows
- bioregional knowledge commons

This primes them for deeper collaboration.

---

## **Mid–Late March 2026 — Targeted Outreach Using CTA Recording**

With your March blog and CTA recording:

### 🔥 1. Anita & Sam (Holochain ecosystem)
- “Here’s the CTA update presentation.”
- Offer a MAP + DAHN session for their newsletter readers.

### 🔥 2. BRANE developers
- Present DAHN as the perfect environment for BRANE’s graph visualizer.
- Invite collaboration for Visualizer Commons.

### 🔥 3. Maptio creator
- Show how Maptio expresses AgentSpace nesting
- Invite him to become a core visualizer contributor.

---

## **April–May 2026 — Private Holochain Leadership Briefing**

Invite:
- Arthur Brock
- Eric Harris-Braun

Share:
- CTA recording
- March blog
- MAP architectural evolution
- Early DAHN interest
- R3.0 resonance

By this point, your credibility and alignment are established.

---

## **Summer 2026 — First DAHN Reveal**

☀️ **Even a minimal prototype qualifies.**

Possible forms:
- Graph navigation
- Basic holon inspector
- Threshold-awareness visualizer
- AgentSpace nesting viewer

Reveal to:
- CTA
- Design School
- Planet Project
- Collapse-aware community
- R3.0

This marks the experiential birth of MAP.

# 🌀 Narrative Flow Overview

You are guiding communities through a coherent, sequential memetic process:

1. **Collapse is real and unfolding now.**
2. **Our sensemaking and coordination systems are failing.**
3. **Regenerative futures demand new cultural foundations.**
4. **But these require a reimagined technological substrate.**
5. **MAP embodies that reimagining.**
6. **DAHN is how people will experience that world.**
7. **Here’s how you can help build it.**

R3.0 enters **before** the public articulation of Step 4–6, ensuring they feel insider resonance.

# 🌟 Key Integrations

### ✔ R3.0 meets you in early December
(Behind-the-scenes conceptual alignment)

### ✔ CTA meets you in early January
(Technical recruitment + momentum)

### ✔ Public meets you in December → March
(Collapse narrative → tech reimagination)

### ✔ Holochain ecosystem meets you in March–April
(Now backed by social proof and conceptual rigor)

### ✔ Early DAHN reveal builds the bridge from concept → lived experience
(summer 2026)

# 🧚 Final Reflection

This plan now:

- honors your relationships
- respects MAP’s true developmental timeline
- brings R3.0 into the narrative at the perfect moment
- gives developers sufficient lead time
- builds a memetic scaffold for your March blog
- prepares multiple ecosystems for MAP’s emergence
