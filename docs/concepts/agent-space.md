# AgentSpace

An **AgentSpace** is the holonic identity of an Agent within the MAP — a single entity experienced through two inseparable aspects:

- its **interior aspect**: the *I-Space*
- its **relational aspect**: participation in one or more *We-Spaces*

An AgentSpace is simultaneously a **whole** (with its own Sovereign Data Sphere and interior processes) and a **part** (participating in larger collective spaces). This dual nature reflects its holonic structure: every AgentSpace is both autonomous and interconnected.

---

# Definition

An **AgentSpace** is a membrane-defined locus of agency, meaning-making, stewardship, and participation.  
It represents the Agent as:

1. a **sovereign interior world** (I-Space)
2. a **relational participant** in shared contexts (We-Spaces)

AgentSpaces are the nodes of the MAP’s living holonic network. Every person, group, organization, or emergent social organism operates as an AgentSpace.

---

# Purpose

The AgentSpace provides:

### **1. A unified identity for the Agent**
Whether the Agent is an individual, a family, a cooperative, or a bioregion, the AgentSpace represents its wholeness.

### **2. A membrane for governing flows**
The AgentSpace protects autonomy through:
- trust channels
- visibility rules
- information access agreements
- membership boundaries

### **3. A substrate for participation**
The AgentSpace joins We-Spaces, forms commitments, and engages in coordination.

### **4. A developmental container**
LifeCode, identity, narrative, and meaning structures evolve inside the AgentSpace.

### **5. A coherent home for the Agent’s sub-agents**
Internal personas, assistants, and processes remain aligned through the single holonic identity of the AgentSpace.

# The Two Aspects of an AgentSpace

Every AgentSpace expresses itself through two inseparable aspects:

```
            AgentSpace (holon)
           /                     \
      I-Space                 We-Space(s)
    (interior)               (relational)
```

These are not separate entities — they are **perspectives** on the same holon.

# I-Space
### *The interior aspect of an AgentSpace*

The **I-Space** is the AgentSpace as experienced from within.  
It contains everything the Agent stewards privately and autonomously.

### Contents of the I-Space

#### **1. Sovereign Data Sphere (SDS)**
The Agent’s complete interior informational world:
- stewarded holons
- references to external holons
- lineage and provenance
- internal meaning structures
- preferences, drafts, interpretations
- identity and persona holons

This is the core of the I-Space.

#### **2. Sub-Agents and Internal Processes**
All internal assistants, personas, automations, and local services operate within the I-Space and against the SDS.

#### **3. Internal Expression of the LifeCode**
The Agent’s:
- values
- principles
- intentions
- developmental aims
- narrative identity

These shape the Agent’s autonomy and meaning.

#### **4. Private Commitments and Not-Yet-Shared Holons**
Draft promises, internal notes, preparatory work, and exploratory structures remain private inside the I-Space until shared through a Trust Channel.

#### **5. Internal State and Configuration**
Service configuration, preferences, local workflows, and internal resource mappings also reside here.

### Purpose of the I-Space

The I-Space supports:
- autonomy
- private cognition
- meaning-making
- personal coherence
- preparation for coordination
- internal safety
- continuity across We-Spaces

# We-Spaces
### *The relational aspect of an AgentSpace*

A **We-Space** is any shared AgentSpace that multiple Agents participate in via mutual Agreements.

Each AgentSpace participates in **one or more** We-Spaces — but does not lose sovereignty when doing so.

### Contents of a We-Space

#### **1. Participating Agents**
Each AgentSpace joins as a whole Agent, not as a fragmented identity.

The We-Space includes:
- membership lists
- roles
- thresholds
- commitments to participate

#### **2. Agreements, Promises, and Offers**
We-Spaces hold:
- shared Agreements
- active Promises
- Offers made into the Space
- governance rules
- obligations and rights

All of these are public to members of the Space.

#### **3. Shared Context and Intent**
The We-Space expresses:
- purpose
- mission or intention
- governance scaffolds
- decision-making processes
- cultural norms
- access and visibility rules

#### **4. Active Coordination and Interaction State**
Live relational dynamics occur here:
- Dances
- signal exchanges
- negotiation flows
- service invocation
- event logs
- role enactment

None of this belongs to any individual SDS.

#### **5. References Into Agents’ SDSs**
A We-Space does not store or steward member data.  
It only holds **references** to holons inside each Agent’s SDS, governed by trust-channel permissions.

### Purpose of We-Spaces

We-Spaces enable:
- collaboration
- mutual commitment
- shared governance
- collective meaning-making
- vital capital flows
- coordinated action

All without compromising individual sovereignty.

# Relationship Between I-Space and We-Spaces

The relationship can be summarized simply:

### **I-Space = what the Agent *is* internally**
### **We-Spaces = what the AgentSpace *participates in* externally**

The AgentSpace integrates both aspects into one coherent holon.

- The I-Space provides the Agent’s interior coherence.
- We-Spaces provide relational coherence across Agents.
- The membrane of the AgentSpace mediates all flows between the two.

---

# Roles of an AgentSpace

### **1. Identity Anchor**
Defines the Agent’s existence as a coherent holon.

### **2. Sovereign Steward**
Holds the SDS and governs its access.

### **3. Coordination Participant**
Enters We-Spaces and fulfills Promises.

### **4. Boundary Protector**
Enforces membrane rules and trust policies.

### **5. Developmental Organism**
Evolves its LifeCode, meaning, and capabilities.

### **6. Context Integrator**
Synthesizes experiences across many We-Spaces into internal coherence.

### **7. Host for Sub-Agents**
Provides a unified substrate on which internal agents operate.

# Summary

An **AgentSpace** is the holonic identity of an Agent — the unified entity that holds a private, sovereign interior (I-Space) and simultaneously participates in shared relational contexts (We-Spaces).  
Its interiors contain the Sovereign Data Sphere, sub-agents, meaning structures, and private commitments.  
Its relational contexts hold shared agreements, roles, governance structures, and collaborative dynamics.

Together, these aspects make the AgentSpace the fundamental unit of agency, autonomy, coordination, and meaning-making in the MAP.
