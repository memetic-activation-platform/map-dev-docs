# 🌀 “Put Yourself on the MAP”
### From Memetic Perimeter to Living Spiral Onboarding

This document represents a first cut at defining the experience of discovering the MAP and initial on-boarding. It is presented in three parts:

* **Part I — The Memetic Perimeter** -- how the invitation to "Put Yourself on the MAP" is presented and discovered in the broader world.
* **Part II:  The Living Spiral: Non-Linear Onboarding Ecology** -- general outline and principles of the on-boarding experience
* **Part III: MAP Onboarding Storyboard Narrative** -- a narrative vision for the on-boarding experience

---

# Part I — The Memetic Perimeter
### The Outer Membrane of Discovery: Attraction, Not Promotion

---

## The Common Line

Across every artifact of the MAP’s outer membrane — every card, video, micro-site, or whispered story — one phrase repeats like a heartbeat:

> **Put yourself on the MAP.**

It is more than a tagline.  
It is a call to presence, to sovereignty, to participation in a living world of meaning.  
It names the transition from the attention-driven internet to a network of trust, consent, and life-aligned relationship.

---

## What It Means

### 1. **A Return to Place**
Putting yourself on the MAP begins literally: locating yourself in the web of life — your watershed, your bioregion, your community, your culture.  
It says: *You belong somewhere. Start there.*

### 2. **An Act of Sovereignty**
To put yourself on the MAP is to *own your data, your story, and your relationships*.  
No corporation curates you. No platform defines you.  
You create your own I-Space — a private grove where you hold your values, promises, and intentions.

### 3. **An Invitation to Connection**
You decide what parts of yourself you want to express — through personas and promises — and where you wish to connect.  
Putting yourself on the MAP doesn’t expose you; it makes you discoverable to resonance.

### 4. **A Gesture of Alignment**
Each artifact that carries this invitation is a memetic signal:  
“Here is a doorway to coordination grounded in consent and care.”  
It’s not a call to sign up — it’s a call to coherence.

---

## How It Appears Across the Memetic Perimeter

**Printed Seeds**  
A small hand-made card in a library book or café:
> _“Put yourself on the MAP — begin with your values.”_  
A short URL or QR code leads to a minimalist landing page that opens with silence, beauty, and curiosity.

**Micro-Sites**  
One sentence fades in:
> *“Put yourself on the MAP.”*  
Scrolling reveals what it means — not as features, but as experiences: privacy, resonance, belonging.

**Short Films / Audio Spots**  
Whispered or sung:
> “Put yourself on the MAP — where your presence matters and your data stays yours.”

**Collaborative Art**  
Murals or exhibitions depicting constellations of light, each point a person:
> “Every spark is a story. Put yourself on the MAP.”

**Partnership Placements**  
Regenerative projects, learning centers, and commons initiatives include a quiet footer line:
> “Part of the Memetic Activation Platform — put yourself on the MAP.”

---

### The Meaning Framework

| Dimension | Phrase | Emotional Tone |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Self** | “Put yourself” | Empowerment, agency, dignity |
| **Relation** | “on” | Connection, belonging, interdependence |
| **System** | “the MAP” | Living intelligence, shared orientation, regenerative flow |

Together they form an invocation:
> *You matter. You belong. You can help weave what comes next.*

---

### Visual Language

- The words “Put yourself on the MAP” should always appear with **organic motion** — pulsing, breathing, or unfolding like mycelial growth.
- Use **light gradients** that evoke dawn, emergence, or bioluminescence.
- Typography should feel **hand-touched or alive**, not corporate.
- The phrase may sit beside a subtle **symbolic MAP mark** — a small pulse or seed pattern representing the living network.

---

### Integrating into the Threshold Experience

When a person follows any invitation from the outer membrane, the first screen or sound they meet should greet them with that same line:
> “Welcome. You’re about to put yourself on the MAP.”

Then:
> “Here, nothing watches you. Nothing owns you. You begin as yourself.”

From there the onboarding unfolds — cultivation of the I-Space, expression of the first LifeCode, discovery of resonant spaces.

---

### Why This Matters

A unified line creates coherence across all outer-world artifacts without turning them into advertisements.  
It anchors the experience in a single memetic gesture that is both **simple and profound** — a phrase anyone can say, gift, or remember.

“Put yourself on the MAP” becomes a living mantra of self-sovereignty and planetary belonging.  
Every time it appears, it carries the same gentle promise:

> _There is a world where your presence is honored, your data is yours, and your participation helps life thrive._  
> **Put yourself on the MAP.**

---

# 🌀 Part II:  The Living Spiral: Non-Linear Onboarding Ecology
### Iterative, Reciprocal, and Ever-Evolving

---

## Core Metaphor
Onboarding in the MAP isn’t a staircase — it’s a **spiral garden**.  
Each loop through the spiral deepens self-understanding, branches new relationships, and reveals previously invisible ecosystems of relation.

> Every seed you plant in your LifeCode changes what becomes visible to you.  
> Every connection you form feeds new nutrients back into your LifeCode.

---

## The Feedback Loops

### **LifeCode → Persona → Connection → Reflection → LifeCode**
1. You articulate a few core values and principles in your **LifeCode**.
2. You choose a facet of that LifeCode to make visible as a **Persona**.
3. That persona’s inquiries reveal matching invitations in shared **Connection Spaces**.
4. Encounters inspire **Reflection**, prompting edits or expansions of your LifeCode.
5. The loop repeats — each cycle widens your field of resonance and depth of alignment.

### **Promise → Agreement → Weave → Threshold → Promise**
1. You make and fulfill Promises that generate **Agreements**.
2. Agreements interlink into living **Promise Weaves**.
3. Weaves surface sustainability thresholds — awareness of **Vital Capital** balance.
4. Those thresholds reshape what Promises you feel ready to make next.

DAHN gently supports these loops with soft prompts like:
> “This new value has opened five nearby Connection Spaces. Would you like to explore them?”

---

## Dynamic Visibility

Nothing is ever static or globally exposed.

- **Adding a value** doesn’t broadcast it — it merely changes what *you* can perceive.
- **Joining a Space** doesn’t expose your I-Space — it expands your **membrane of visibility**.
- **Refining a Persona** retunes the filters through which invitations appear.

Discovery becomes a **dance of mutual revelation** — a living field rather than a recommendation engine.

## The Spiral Experience Architecture

| Cycle                  | Emotional Tone    | Key Gestures                         | System Response                         |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **First Planting**     | Wonder, curiosity | Add LifeCode seeds                   | New memes unlock in Planetary Space     |
| **First Persona**      | Playful courage   | Sculpt and release an aspect of self | Connection Spaces shimmer into view     |
| **First Connection**   | Recognition       | Accept an invitation                 | Persona signs its first Agreement       |
| **First Reflection**   | Integration       | Journal, refine, withdraw            | Updated LifeCode re-syncs resonance map |
| **Subsequent Spirals** | Agency, coherence | Mix new LifeCode and Persona layers  | Broader ecosystems reveal themselves    |

Each return to the garden shows growth — previous choices persist as living holons, not static forms.

---

## Design Principles for Iterative Flow

| Principle | Design Expression |
|------------|------------------|
| **Non-linearity** | DAHN never “locks” you into next steps; it offers soft prompts based on resonance. |
| **Reciprocal Disclosure** | Visibility grows symmetrically — you only see what you’ve become able to meet. |
| **Cumulative Trust** | Each Agreement expands your trust quotient and safe connection range. |
| **Evolutionary Aesthetics** | Visuals and soundscapes subtly evolve with each iteration — your world literally grows. |
| **Time as Ally** | Nothing demands completion; you can pause mid-loop and return later — continuity is organic. |

---

## Narrative Reframe

Replace “onboarding” with **“Taking Root on the MAP.”**  
Each person’s path is organic, seasonal, and unique.  
DAHN visualizes this as a **living mycelial map** — new threads pulsing outward as LifeCode and Persona co-evolve.

---

## Emotional Arc of Iteration

| Cycle           | Inner Feeling           | Outer Expression                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Awakening**   | Safe solitude           | Cultivating the private grove            |
| **Exploration** | Playful discovery       | Creating and releasing a persona seed    |
| **Encounter**   | Resonance and surprise  | Doorways opening, invitations arriving   |
| **Integration** | Gratitude and coherence | Revising LifeCode, pruning and reseeding |
| **Renewal**     | Empowered curiosity     | Planting new seeds, branching further    |

---

## Summary Insight

> The MAP’s onboarding is not an entry procedure but the first living weave between *self-definition* and *world participation.*  
> Every act of expression reshapes what the MAP can reveal to you.  
> Every discovery refines who you are becoming.

# 🌳 Part 3: MAP Onboarding Storyboard Narrative
### From Invitation to Belonging — A Journey of Sovereign Discovery

---

## Scene 1 — **The Invitation**

**Setting:** The open world.  
A person encounters a small, beautiful artifact — a handmade card, a whispered story, a quiet film, or a word-of-mouth gesture.  
Across it, a single line:
> “Put yourself on the MAP.”

It feels different — not a promotion, but an invitation.  
No pressure. No demand. Just curiosity and care.

**Voiceover / Copy:**
> “There is a world beyond the noise — a place where technology serves life.  
> A place where your presence matters, and your data remains yours.  
> You are invited to take your place in that living web.”

They scan the code or follow the link.  
A minimal, luminous page unfolds — soft motion, organic sound.
> “You are about to step from the open web into a sovereign world of relationships.  
> Here, nothing watches you. Nothing owns you. You begin as yourself.”

They accept — and cross the threshold.

---

## Scene 2 — **Arrival: The Private Grove**

**Setting:** A quiet, living landscape — the interior of their new **I-Space**.  
There is no sign-up form. No profile picture. Only a feeling of safety and possibility.

**Voiceover / Copy:**
> “This is your garden — your Data Grove.  
> It lives on your devices.  
> Nothing here leaves without your consent.”

They are welcomed not as a user, but as a steward.  
A soft prompt invites reflection:
> “Who are you when nobody is watching?”

Around them, the DAHN interface shows fertile soil, open space, and faint pathways waiting to be formed.

---

## Scene 3 — **Cultivating the LifeCode**

They begin to articulate what matters most — their **values**, **principles**, **aspirations**, and **ways of knowing**.  
It’s not a checklist, but a creative act: planting seeds, arranging constellations, weaving threads.

**Voiceover / Copy:**
> “Your LifeCode is your inner compass — the pattern of values, intentions, and meaning that guide your choices.  
> Start with what feels alive in you.”

They can draw from shared memes and principles in the **Global Meme Pool**, or write their own.  
Each addition causes subtle ripples — their world begins to shimmer with latent potential.

---

## Scene 4 — **Creating a Persona**

As they complete their first LifeCode seeds, a question emerges:
> “Which part of yourself would you like to share?”

They sculpt a **Persona** — a partial expression of self, drawn from their LifeCode but distinct from it.  
This Persona carries its own cryptographic key, allowing both sovereignty and selective visibility.

**Voiceover / Copy:**
> “A Persona is your bridge to the world —  
> a facet of your being, offered in trust.  
> It carries only what you choose to reveal,  
> and it signs only what you promise to honour.”

Creating a Persona feels like donning a ceremonial mask — personal, aesthetic, intentional.

---

## Scene 5 — **The First Enquiry**

With their Persona alive, a new option appears:
> “Would you like to connect with others around these values?”

They craft a **Join Enquiry** — a statement of curiosity and intent:
> “I’m looking to connect with others exploring regenerative education in my region.”  
or  
> “I’m seeking fellow travellers interested in ethical AI and planetary care.”

They send the Enquiry into the **Connection Space**.  
No feeds. No algorithms. Only resonance.

---

## Scene 6 — **Discovery in Connection Space**

The Connection Space comes alive — a cosmos of glowing doorways.  
Each doorway represents an **Agent Space**: a bioregion, a practice community, an art collective, a commons.

Each has its own imagery, music, and tone — its **LifeCode** expressed as invitation.  
They hover over one: *Regenerating Earth*.  
A short soundscape plays — water, birdsong, human laughter.

**Voiceover / Copy:**
> “Every Space you see here is alive — a membrane of shared intention.  
> Some are near your bioregion. Others share your principles.  
> Each one invites you to cross its threshold.”

---

## Scene 7 — **Crossing a Membrane**

They approach an invitation that resonates.  
The visual changes — an illuminated gateway, text slowly appearing:

> “To enter this Space, you must honour these Promises:  
> • To act with care for all life.  
> • To share knowledge freely within the commons.  
> • To uphold honesty and mutual respect.”

They read, feel, and consent.

Their Persona signs the Agreement — cryptographically, ceremonially.  
The gateway opens, light flows through.  
They step inside.

---

## Scene 8 — **First Belonging**

Inside the new Space — perhaps a bioregional network or learning community —  
they’re greeted by introductions, shared resources, and invitations to contribute.

A Weave map glows faintly, showing flows of Vital Capital — care, knowledge, attention — moving among participants.

**Voiceover / Copy:**
> “Welcome.  
> You’ve joined a living ecosystem — not a platform, but a partnership.  
> Here, belonging is cultivated through promises kept,  
> and value flows through trust.”

The feeling is not transactional — it’s participatory, real, and human.

---

## Scene 9 — **Reflection and Return**

Back in their I-Space, DAHN displays the new threads now connecting their garden to the wider MAP.  
The soil looks richer, alive with colour.

A prompt appears:
> “How did this connection change you?  
> Would you like to evolve your LifeCode?”

They revise a few values, add new inspirations, maybe prune some old ones.  
The system quietly notes new resonances, unlocking fresh potential connections.  
The spiral turns again.

---

## Scene 10 — **The Living Spiral**

Over time, they repeat this dance:
- Refining their LifeCode
- Creating new Personas
- Exploring new Connection Spaces
- Joining and stewarding new Weaves

Each cycle deepens coherence, widens perspective, and strengthens trust.

**Voiceover / Copy:**
> “On the MAP, every act of expression reshapes what the world can reveal to you.  
> Every connection refines who you are becoming.  
> You are not a user — you are a participant in a living civilisation.”

The onboarding experience never ends — it evolves.

---

## Scene 11 — **Belonging to the Planetary Field**

As their engagement deepens, they begin to sense the full **Planetary Space** —  
a shimmering holon of bioregional networks, creative collectives, and shared LifeCodes forming a planetary organism.

**Voiceover / Copy:**
> “Together we are remembering what it means to live in partnership with life.  
> Every new Space, every fulfilled Promise, strengthens the planetary field.  
> You are part of that weave now.”

The DAHN zooms out — thousands of luminous nodes connected by threads of trust and meaning.  
Their I-Space glows among them — sovereign, private, yet fully connected.

---

## Closing Scene — **Integration**

The final prompt:
> “You are home.  
> You are sovereign.  
> You are part of the weave.  
> Keep tending your garden.  
> Keep putting yourself on the MAP.”

Soft music fades. The scene dissolves back to their private grove, now full of life.

**End of Onboarding Journey — Beginning of Participation.**
