# MAP Core Developers

This documentation set is for **MAP Core Developers** — those who steward, evolve, and maintain the foundational infrastructure of the Memetic Activation Platform.

MAP Core Developers work at the deepest layers of the system, shaping:
- The **agent-centric architecture** of MAP
- The **holonic type system** and schema foundations
- Core protocols such as **Dances**, **TrustChannels**, and **Agreements**
- Validation, evolution, and interoperability rules that all other MAP capabilities depend on

These documents focus on **design intent, architectural constraints, and evolution strategy**, not just implementation details. They aim to make the system *legible* — so that changes can be made responsibly, extensions can remain compatible, and long-term coherence is preserved.

Much of the content here is **actively evolving**. MAP Core Developers are expected to reason about tradeoffs, not simply follow recipes. Where patterns are still emerging, this documentation will say so explicitly.

If you are looking to:
- Extend MAP with new capabilities → see **Holon Extension Developers**
- Build human-facing interfaces and experiences → see **Human Experience Developers**

This space exists to support the careful stewardship of MAP’s core — the substrate on which all higher-level ecosystems grow.

If you want, I can also:
- generate matching `index.md` pages for **Holon Extension Developers** and **Human Experience Developers**
- tune the tone slightly more technical or slightly more invitational
- add a minimal “How this doc set is organized” section without locking structure too early
