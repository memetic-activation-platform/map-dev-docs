# üßæ MAP Transaction Model Specification

This document proposes a design for a Transaction Model used in the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP), grounding it in MAP‚Äôs architectural principles and comparing it to event sourcing, Holochain, and CRDT systems.

---

## üîπ Overview: What Is a Transaction in MAP?

A **Transaction** in MAP is a semantically meaningful, multi-operation commit unit that:

- Encapsulates one or more staged holon or relationship updates.
- Records validation outcomes, operation logs, and possible compensating operations.
- Results in either a validated commit, an invalid provisional state, or a rollback.

Transactions serve both as:
- A **logical unit of change** (semantic granularity),
- And a **backbone for undo, validation, and resolution semantics**.

## üß± Structure of a Transaction Holon

```
{
  "type": "#TransactionType",
  "properties": {
    "transaction_id": "txn:2025-08-19T17:54Z:87af0",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-19T17:54:33Z",
    "initiated_by": "Agent:alice",
    "final_state": "CommittedWithWarnings"  // or "Validated", "Failed", "RolledBack"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "Updated": [ "$ref": "Holon:book:MAP" ],
    "HasValidationResult": [ "$ref": "#validation-too-many-tags" ],
    "HasOperationLog": [ "$ref": "#op-1", "$ref": "#op-2" ],
    "Compensates": [ "$ref": "#Transaction:txn-original" ]
  }
}
```

### Key Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `transaction_id` | Unique identifier for the transaction. |
| `initiated_by` | Agent or process that initiated the commit. |
| `final_state` | Enum: `Validated`, `CommittedWithWarnings`, `Failed`, `RolledBack`, etc. |
| `timestamp` | When the transaction was created. |

### Key Relationships

| Relationship | Target | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| `Updated` | Holon(s) | All holons affected in the transaction. |
| `HasValidationResult` | ValidationResult | Records rule checks applied post-commit. |
| `HasOperationLog` | OperationLog | Stores user-facing or compensatory operation sequences. |
| `Compensates` | Transaction | Links to the prior transaction being rolled back. |

## üìö Best Practices Integrated into the Transaction Model

### ‚úÖ Event Sourcing Practices

| Event Sourced Concept | MAP Equivalent |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Event stream per aggregate | `StagedHolon` per entry |
| Append-only log | `OperationLog` attached to Transaction |
| Optimistic concurrency (OCC) | OCC applied at commit time using version check |
| Snapshot for materialized state | Materialized `StagedHolon` represents final state |
| Sagas for long transactions | `Transaction` + `Compensates` + Agreement policies |
| **Read model projection** | **Nursery maintains a transient, fully materialized view of all holons in the Transaction scope** |

### Key Takeaway
MAP treats the Transaction Holon as the **bounded event stream unit**, aggregating property/relationship changes into a single validation and commit phase. The **Nursery** functions as an ephemeral **read model** or **projection layer**, allowing efficient access to the current state during staged editing and commit processing ‚Äî much like a projection in traditional event-sourced systems.

---

## üåÄ Holochain Comparisons

| Holochain Concept | MAP Layer |
|-------------------|-----------|
| `create_entry`, `update_entry` ops | Underlying backing store for Holons |
| Action Hash graph | Reflected in `SemanticVersion` and `Updated` links |
| DHT validation callbacks | Wrapped into MAP‚Äôs third-pass commit validation |
| Branching via multiple updates | Tracked and resolved via `ValidationResult` + `ConflictsWith` |

### Key Takeaway
MAP extends Holochain‚Äôs ‚Äúvalidation-on-each-op‚Äù model by layering **transaction-level, type-aware, and agreement-aware validation** atop the raw chain mechanics.

---

## üîÅ CRDT Perspective

| CRDT Trait | MAP Position |
|------------|--------------|
| Automatic conflict resolution | Not automatic ‚Äî requires rule- or agreement-based merge logic |
| Merge-on-receipt | Delayed, semantic resolution during validation or review |
| Convergence guarantee | Conditional ‚Äî governed by AgreementScope and policies |
| Operation deltas | Represented via fine-grained `OperationLog` commands |
| Composability | Holon structure is the merge target, not the CRDT state itself |

### Key Takeaway
MAP‚Äôs Transaction Model **prioritizes semantic correctness over blind convergence**. It supports CRDT-style operational tracking but rejects automatic merging unless declared via policy.

---

## üß† Strategic Benefits of This Model

- Enables **fine-grained UX undo** without polluting the DHT.
- Supports **event sourcing patterns** while maintaining a clean, materialized model.
- Adds semantic structure on top of **Holochain‚Äôs low-level operation model**.
- Leaves room for **application- and agreement-scoped conflict resolution**, aligning with MAP‚Äôs governance-first design.

---

## üìå Open Extensions (Future)

- `ResolutionPolicy` holons linked to `AgreementScope` and `ApplicationScope`
- `MergeResolution` holons for explicit fork merging
- Automatic detection of unresolved forks and triggering of merge workflows
- Parallel Transaction Streams per AgreementSpace

## üå± The MAP Transaction Model

In the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP), every set of proposed changes to holons is staged in a local **Nursery** before being committed. A **Transaction** holon represents this unit of change. It is created at commit time and holds:

- Relationships to a set of **ValidationResult** holons
- Links to all **updated Holons** (via those results)
- State transitions such as `Unvalidated` ‚Üí `Validated` ‚Üí `Committed` or `RolledBack`
- Optional logging of **fine-grained operations** to support undo/redo and compensating transactions

The MAP‚Äôs layered design separates **validation** (ensuring semantic correctness and consistency) from **persistence** (recording changes in the source of truth). Validation is performed before commit using rules scoped by both application logic and shared agreements (e.g. cardinality checks, role consistency, semantic integrity, etc.).

---

## ü™µ Nursery as a Read Model (Projection Layer)

In Event Sourced systems, **projections** (also called read models) are derived views of the event stream, optimized for user interaction. The MAP **Nursery** serves this role during a transaction:

- It maintains a **materialized view** of holons after every staged change.
- Ergonomic client APIs (e.g. `with_property`, `add_relationship`) mutate this staged state.
- These lightweight operations can be **logged as Commands**, enabling undo/redo support.
- Only at commit time is the transaction finalized and written as an immutable update.

## üîÅ Comparison to Event Sourcing Systems

| Aspect                        | Event Sourcing                       | MAP Transaction Model                      |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Core Persistence Model       | Append-only event log                | Append-only holon updates (via DHT)        |
| Aggregates                   | Derived from replaying events        | Materialized holons in nursery projections |
| Validation                   | Done before/after event persistence  | Done in the nursery, before commit         |
| Transaction Representation   | Often lacks explicit transaction     | Explicit `Transaction` holon               |
| Undo/Redo                    | By reversing events or snapshots     | Via logged staged operations in nursery    |
| Compensating Transactions    | Application-defined                  | Tracked via new Transaction holons         |
| Concurrency Control          | Typically OCC or snapshot isolation  | MVCC + Agreement-Scoped Conflict Resolution|

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è MVCC in MAP vs Other Concurrency Strategies

### ‚úÖ MAP uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

- Each holon update produces a new immutable version
- Writers do not block each other ‚Äî they create **parallel branches**
- Version history is preserved and traceable
- Conflict detection is **deferred**, and resolution is semantic (not structural)

### ‚ùå Not Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)

- OCC would reject commits if the read version was outdated
- MAP instead accepts the write, creating a new fork
- This **branching behavior** supports collaborative divergence before reconciliation

## üß† Conflict Resolution Strategies: CRDTs vs Holochain vs MAP

| Feature                         | CRDTs                                 | Holochain                              | MAP                                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Conflict-Free?                  | Claims "conflict-free" via auto-merge | Leaves resolution to the application   | Explicitly supports semantic conflicts       |
| Merge Strategy                  | Structural (e.g. last-write-wins, ORSet) | None by default                         | Application + Agreement-Scoped Semantics    |
| Determinism                     | Always converges                       | No built-in convergence                 | Resolution logic is pluggable per domain    |
| Lost Updates Possible?          | Yes (e.g. in LWW)                      | Yes                                     | Yes ‚Äî but tracked and resolvable            |
| Undo Support                    | Limited                                | Manual                                  | Fine-grained undo via operation log         |
| Update Representation           | Per-property, tombstones, deltas       | Entry-level action history              | Per-holon, with ergonomic staging granularity|
| Versioning Model                | Conflict-resolution per data type      | Full action chain (via hashes)          | Holon-level branches tracked via hashes     |

> üîç Note: While CRDTs automatically resolve structural conflicts, they often do so at the cost of **semantic predictability**. MAP preserves all branches and delegates resolution to **shared agreements** and **application logic**.

---

## üìú Agreement Scopes and Application Scopes

To support meaningful conflict resolution:

- **Agreement Scope**: Specifies the **participants** and **rules** (e.g. communities, working groups) that govern semantic resolution.
- **Application Scope**: Defines the **data boundaries** (e.g. all holons in a shared Space) to which resolution applies.

Resolution logic is therefore anchored in both the **social commitments** and the **data model** ‚Äî ensuring that divergent updates are reconciled in a trustworthy, context-aware way.

---

## üß© Summary

MAP‚Äôs Transaction model offers:

- A **clear separation** of staging, validation, and commit phases
- Fine-grained operation tracking for undo/redo and compensation
- Explicit **MVCC-style version branching** with later reconciliation
- A hybrid model blending **Event Sourcing**, **Holochain DHT consistency**, and **semantic conflict resolution** that goes beyond CRDTs

This design supports both a robust technical foundation and the social contracts required for trustworthy, collaborative data stewardship.
