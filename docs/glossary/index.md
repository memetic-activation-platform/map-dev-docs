# MAP Glossary

This glossary defines the **shared conceptual vocabulary** used across the
Memetic Activation Platform (MAP) ecosystem.

It serves as a **canonical reference** for terms that appear in:
- MAP Core architecture and protocols
- DAHN and semantic experience design
- MAP application and integration documentation

Where terms are used differently in narrative, architectural, or technical
contexts, those distinctions are made explicit.

As MAP evolves, this glossary evolves with it.
