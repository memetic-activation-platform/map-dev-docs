# MAP Developer Documentation

Welcome to the MAP Developer Documentation.

This site is intended to support developers, schema authors, and community contributors who are building with the MAP Type System and holonic data structures.

MAP is designed to be:

- **Self-describing** â€” every type is a holon
- **Composable** â€” types and schemas can be extended without breaking compatibility
- **Federated** â€” schema evolution happens across a network of independently defined but interoperable types

## ðŸ§­ Getting Started

This documentation is still evolving. For now, you can:

- Explore the type system design in the MAP wiki
- Review example import files in `schemas/` if available
- Watch this space for developer guides and schema authoring tips

Weâ€™ll be adding more structured guides and references as the project grows. Contributions are welcome.
