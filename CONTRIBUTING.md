# Contributing to the MAP Developer Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing! The MAP project depends on collective stewardship, and we deeply appreciate your support in evolving clear, accurate, and accessible documentation.

## ðŸ’¡ Ways to Contribute

You can help in many ways:

- Fixing typos or grammar
- Improving explanations and examples
- Adding missing sections
- Documenting new features or concepts
- Sharing ideas for better organization or structure

## ðŸ“„ Editing Existing Docs

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch:  
   `git checkout -b improve-docs`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with a clear message:  
   `git commit -m "Clarify description of HolonType"`
5. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request

Weâ€™ll review your PR, suggest changes if needed, and work with you to merge it.

## ðŸ“š Writing New Pages

If you want to add a new guide, reference, or overview page:

- Use plain Markdown (`.md`)
- Organize within the `docs/` or `guides/` directory
- Use [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case) for file names (e.g., `type-descriptors.md`)
- Include a clear heading and introductory paragraph
- Use relative links to other docs when possible

We aim to keep the tone **welcoming**, **precise**, and **explorable** â€” like a conversation between peers.

## ðŸ§ª Style Guide (WIP)

Weâ€™re working toward a unified style. In the meantime:

- Prefer active voice
- Use second person sparingly
- Format code examples clearly (use triple backticks for blocks)
- Include examples when introducing a concept
- Favor clarity over cleverness
