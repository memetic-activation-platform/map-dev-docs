# MAP Developer Documentation

Welcome to the **MAP Developer Documentation** repository. This is the canonical source for technical documentation related to the [Memetic Activation Platform (MAP)](https://map.foundation/), a holonic, agent-centric system designed for decentralized coordination and cultural evolution.

This documentation is intended for:

- **Developers** building MAP integrations or tooling  
- **Schema authors** designing custom types and relationships  
- **Community members** contributing to the evolution of the MAP type system

## üìö What's in this Repository

- `docs/`: Modular documentation covering core concepts, architectural layers, and extension patterns
- `schemas/`: Example type definitions and import files (JSON)
- `guides/`: Practical implementation walkthroughs and usage scenarios
- `references/`: In-depth explanations of type kinds, definer functions, and validation logic

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Holons**: The foundational units of MAP, each both a whole and a part  
- **Type Descriptors**: Holons that define the structure and semantics of other holons  
- **Keyed and Keyless Holons**: A distinction enabling semantic references and compositional modeling  
- **Schemas**: Living graphs of typed descriptors, introspectable and extensible

For an overview of the type system, see [`MAP Type System`](docs/type-system.md).
