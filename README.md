# MAP Developer Documentation

Welcome to the **MAP Developer Documentation** repository. This is the canonical source for technical documentation related to the **_Memetic Activation Platform_**, a holonic, agent-centric system designed for decentralized coordination and cultural evolution. 

The documentation is structured around **distinct technical audiences**, with additional shared conceptual material.

## 🧭 Audience-Centric Navigation Philosophy

This documentation follows a **role-based navigation model**, making it easier for developers to quickly find relevant guidance based on their involvement with the platform.

It is organized around three primary technical audiences:

---

### 🧱 **Mapp Developers**

Developers interested in understanding the **purpose and value** of adopting MAP, and the **steps and guidelines** for doing so.

There are two architectural options:

1. **Native MAP Applications:** Applications whose persistent data is stored and managed within MAP **Spaces**, using holonic structures natively.

2. **Integrating Applications:** Existing applications that retain their own persistence architecture but expose a **native API** wrapped in a **holonic adapter**. This adapter translates native data types and actions to/from MAP's holonic representation.

> Both approaches require mapping the application to the **MAP Ontology** for semantic alignment and interoperability.

---

### 🎨 **Visualizer Developers**

Developers interested in the **purpose of MAP**, its **open-ended architecture**, and the **value of contributing visualizers** to the **Visualizer Commons** and seeking specific guidelines on how to contribute.

Documentation in this section provides:

- Guidelines for building and registering visualizers
- Principles behind holonic data visualization
- API and composition standards for visualizer modules

---

### ⚙️ **MAP Core Implementers**


Developers responsible for the **design and implementation of MAP’s core functionality**, including:

- The **holon engine**
- **Space and persistence** infrastructure
- Core **type system** and runtime semantics

This audience maintains the foundational functionality that enable mapp and visualizer development.
